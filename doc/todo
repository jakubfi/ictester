DUT:
review all sequential ICs (command changes vs clock, clock polarity, test suitability)

FW/protocol:
univib: pullups
full error handling (protocol)
cmd_hello
protocol and fw versioning
'IC state reset' non-test something
debug verbosity?
protocol frames
PROM/EPROM reading?
CHECKS: check everything early (protocol level if possible => no checks during testing)
CHECKS: allow only meaningfull setups (anything out of ordinary => error)

SW:
bash completion
better test params building
names: LS/S when no regular family? common names? alternatives?

HW:
full HiZ testing (with ~1M to ground? always?)
MCU pin over-current protection (120 ohm)
DUT current measuremet (VCC? GND?)
DUT power over-current protection
R/C: workaround is enough? on relays? tested with GPIO?
R/C: switchable R and C values?
change GND@pin1 to VCC@pin9 to support 18-pin memories?
