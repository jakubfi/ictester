full error handling (protocol)
failed vector reporting
cmd_hello
protocol and fw versioning
review all sequential ICs (command changes vs clock, clock polarity, test suitability)
'IC state reset' non-test something
better params building
debug verbosity?
protocol frames

name matching?
 * exact name (SN7400, UCY7400),
 * common name (7400),
 * difflib fuzzy high similarity (0.8)
 * difflib fuzzy low similarity (0.7?)
 * alternatively: suggestion when no exact/common match?
