--- FW/protocol ----------------------------------------------------------
should cfgnum be moved to zif.c?
mem_setup(); is a part of mem test?
generic "drivers" for tests
cleanup mem/dram naming
full error handling (protocol)
  * check everything everywhere, send meaningfull error codes
  * disallow only setups harmful to the device?
cmd_hello
protocol and fw versioning?
'IC state reset' non-test something? is it required?
PROM/EPROM reading?
framing CRC?

--- SW -------------------------------------------------------------------
tester protocol exceptions
bash completion?
names: LS/S when no regular family? common names? alternatives?
chip autodetection

--- HW -------------------------------------------------------------------
full HiZ testing (with ~1M to ground? always?)
MCU pin over-current protection (120 ohm)
DUT current measuremet (VCC? GND?)
DUT power over-current protection
R/C: workaround is enough? on relays? tested with GPIO?
R/C: switchable R and C values?
change GND@pin1 to VCC@pin9 to support 18-pin memories?
