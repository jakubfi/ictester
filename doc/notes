* Outputs by default have weak pullups connected to make sure MCU inputs are driven
  in case of broken internal IC connections. This can be disabled.
* 3-state outputs aren't really fully tested. Weak pullup ensures reading "1" when output is in HiZ state,
  which allows for catching at least some faults.
* Open-emmiters are "X" outputs of gate expanders (eg. 74H62 or 7460). Pulled low with output driven
  low (sink) on MCU side.
* C and R/C univibrator connections have to be active at the same time.


ICs with slow outputs: 7447 (extra-slow: 5us rise total), 74H62, 7489, 74156, 74170, 780101
